# Kaggle Competition for Machine Learning for Data Science
In an effort to reduce the size our data set, we decided to exclude features from our training data set.  These features were dropped because they either didn't tell us anything useful (ie all entries were 1) or they were redundant.

The following features were dropped from our data set:
0 & 9: concatenation represented in feature 18
2 & 11: concatenation represented in feature 20
7 & 16: concatenation represented in feature 25
56 & 57: concatenation represented in feature 58
29, 31, 32, 35: all entries were 1. There's nothing much we can learn from this.
